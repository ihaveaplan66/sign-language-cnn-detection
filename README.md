# Sign Language Detection with CNN

This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify hand gestures representing numbers and letters in sign language. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and prediction of hand gestures. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of images of hand gestures.
